  export let about = "I am a native of Irvine, California, a student at Bowdoin College, and a visiting student at the University of Oxford. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. I am interested in the intersection of technology and the human good. I believe that technology should be used to improve the lives of people and that it should be used to solve the world's most pressing problems. I am also interested in the philosophy of technology and the ethics of technology. I am currently working on a project that explores the ethics of artificial intelligence and the ethics of autonomous vehicles. I am also interested in the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of language. I am currently working on a project that explores the relationship between language and thought. I am also interested in the philosophy of science and the philosophy of mathematics. I am currently working on a project that explores the nature of scientific theories and the nature of mathematical theories.";
